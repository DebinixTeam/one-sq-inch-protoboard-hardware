# One Sq Inch Prototype Board

This is 1" x 1" `prototyping solderable board`, for breadboard prototyping.

# Specification for the 1 inch x 1 inch Plated Through Hole (PTH) Board

This board is fabricated as panels with 3x4-boards (i.e. 12 in one piece), and can easily be divided by simply breaking them apart to individual 1" x 1" boards.

# Fabrication

This project is open-source, so that you will find this KiCad PCB board design files and gerbers in this repository. Therefore, feel free to modify these files to fit your specific need.

You can directly upload files in the fabrication/GERBERS folder to a prototype service, such as [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com). However, the original fabricated board available on `Tindie` has a high-quality standard. 

If you appreciate our work and use any files, why not buy me a cup of coffee?

I love designing, making, and releasing our projects as open source. I do it because I believe it is essential to share knowledge and give back to the community, as many have done before us. In addition, it helps us all learn and grow. 

That said, time and effort have gone into designing and releasing these files, so please consider supporting us by buying one of our creations in our `Tindie shop`, and they are cheap!
